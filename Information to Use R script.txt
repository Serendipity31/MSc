Tasks that need to be completed before it's 100% operational:

Add current PT students from 2015-2016, 2014-2015 into FeeStatus sheet

Start at row 115 to deal with if/else statement for PT student fee calculation

Create if/else loop to perform tuition fee calculation
> needs to see part of string, and then multiply by 0.05, 0.10, 0.15 accordingly

Ensure everything is adjusted to import from excel

Ensure nothing is done by hand except renaming files appropriately (and setting up the Fee Status file since that can't be avoided)

Adjust and finalise documentation about what needs to be created, in what folders, etc.


NOTES:
For auditing students: Have Elspeth only add as 'class only' to Learn, and then compare 'final' class list with Learn,
and adjust final class list just to ensure no 'class only' students have snuck onto the class list

To get fee status information, use template with correct column headers in B-O.
> This template will need to have retained any on-going PT students from previous 2 years since 
	> Why? They won't show up in the admissions data
	> Just have to remember to extract them each year and put in template for next year, ready to go
Go to Direct Admissions > View Applications
Fill in year, school, Decision\Resposne (as either CFUF or UF), ensure the correct college is ticked, and only PG
Copy and paste in the rows, putting cursor in column A each time (this will put UUNs in column B)
Delete all columns to the right of I (i.e. delete starting with PD column)
Then delete column A, so that UUN is in column A
Then delete column G (Proc_Stat), and B (Title)
This should leave you with UUN, Forename, Surname, FSG, Fee_Status, Decision (in columns A-H)

____________________________________________________________
2. Fill in abbreviations into lists, and complete relevant parts of code (all the way to the output code at the bottom)
3. Figure out how to get script to run non-interactively ...setwd, year, require xlsx, and other setup in this other script???
4. Get sample files from Elspeth to test a full sample batch

5. Create separate version for 2017-2018 when the study tour courses are present
	Will need to allocate teaching to EPM
	Will need to allocate study tour budgets to each programme based on a % split of teachings vs. trip
		Suggest 10% teaching
		Suggest 90% trip
	Will need to add 10% for teaching into taught component summaries
	Will need to create new line for 90% trip money in summary tables to show breakdown
	Will need to create special if/else part of import function to ensure these two courses are treated appropriately
		Suggest changing admin from 40% to 35%
		Suggest increasing % fee from 5% to 10% for these courses

***Assumptions in the code***
1. We only invoice the university for the administration costs in the year a PT student completes their dissertation
2. A 'straight' 5% of the full tuition fee is calculated for each student taking an SRUC course, regardless of what programme/school they are from
3. A 'straight' 10% of the full tuition fee is calculated in association with supervision for each student, regardless of what programme/school they are from 
4. The fraction of the tuition fee that goes to administration is 40%. Of this, SRUC gets 75% and GeoSciences 15%
5. The only relevant schools are GeoSciences, SPSS, Law, Engineering, and Business
6. Students from any programme within these schools may end up using SRUC resources
7. SRUC education staff involved in supervising dissertations are counted as Crosp & Soils staff in order to distinguish them from LEES staff (as this is the big cost centre split)
 
Notational Requirements within the code:
1. The following abbreviations must be used when referring to individual programmes: EE	EPM	FS	SS	SPH
2. The following abbreviations must be used when referring to individual courses: 
		Foundations in Ecological Economics 	- FEE
		ENvironmental Valuation					- EV
		Applications in Ecological Economics	- AEE
		Participation in Policy and Planning	- PPP
		Environmental Impact Assessment			- EIA
		...
		
***Set-up Requirements***
1. Create a folder where the analysis will be undertaken and call it 'SRUC MOU Calculation 2016' (substituting the year as appropriate)
2. Within this folder, create two folders: one called 'Inputs', one called 'Outputs'
3. Look up the file path that takes you into your 'SRUC MOU Calculation 2016' folder (as you'll need this to set the working directory for R)
4. Ensure that the R package 'xlsx' is installed in your version of R
		
***Inputs Required to Run the Code (each of which must be a .csv file)***
1. A file with the tuition fee data for the all programmes in the relevant schools in the year of interest. 

Total Number of files of this type: 1
	
	> The file name must have this format: Fees_year.csv (e.g. Fees_2016.csv)
	> The file must use the following headers (and no other ones): Programme	School	H	O
		> H stands for 'home fees'
		> O stands for 'overseas fees'

2.  A file for each course that is 'owned' by SRUC showing the attendance list for the year of interest. 

Total Number of files of this type: 12(?)

	> The file name must have this format: CourseAbbreviationyear.csv (e.g. FEE2016.csv)
	> The file must use the following headers (and no other ones): UUN	Surname	Forename	Programme	School	Fee_Status
		> The spellings used within the 'Programme' column must be the same as in the tuition fee file (and all other files using this data)
		> 'Fee_Status' must be shown as either H or O (to match with the tuition fee file)

3. A file for each programme that shows the supervisory arrangements for all students on that programme

Total Number of files of this type: 5

	> The file name must have this format: ProgrammeAbbreviation_Dissertationsyear.csv (e.g. EE_Dissertations2016.csv)
	> The file must use the following headers (and no other ones): UUN	Surname	Forename	Programme	School	Fee_Status	Supervisor	Organisation	Detail
		> The spellings used within the 'Programme' column must be the same as in the tuition fee file (and all other files using this data)
		> 'Fee_Status' must be shown as either 'H' or 'O' (to match with the tuition fee file)
		> 'Organisation' must be shown as either 'SRUC' or 'University'
		> 'Detail' is a column used to show whether a supervisor marked 'SRUC' is actually an SRUC employee or an external
			> Accepable entries are 'SRUC' or 'External'

4. A file showing which SRUC staff are supervising non-SRUC dissertations

Total Number of files of this type: 1

	> The file name must have this format: SRUC_ExternalDissertationsyear.csv (e.g. SRUC_ExternalDissertations2016.csv)
	> The file must use the following headers (and no other ones): UUN	Surname	Forename	Programme	School	Fee_Status	Supervisor	Research_Group
		> The spellings used within the 'Programme' column must be the same as in the tuition fee file (and all other files using this data)
		> 'Fee_Status' must be shown as either 'H' or 'O' (to match with the tuition fee file)
		> 'Research_Group' is used to distinguish between LEES and Crops & Soils (any Education staff supervising are counted as being in Crops & Soils for this script)
			> Acceptable entires are 'LEES' or 'CropsSoils'
			
Total Number of Input Files Needed: 19(?)

***Running the Code / Completing the Analysis ***
The following steps are required in order to run the code and complete the analysis:

...

***Outputs Generated***
The script will generate 6 outputs: One summary file containing everything, and one file for each MSc programme. 
These will be created within the 'Outputs' folder created in the setup step described above
