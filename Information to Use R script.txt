Tasks that need to be completed before it's 100% operational:

1. Get complete list of courses owned by each programme
2. Fill in abbreviations into lists, and complete relevant parts of code (all the way to the output code at the bottom)
3. Figure out how to get script to run non-interactively ...setwd, year, require xlsx, and other setup in this other script???
4. Get sample files from Elspeth to test a full sample batch
5. Consider whether to change the import type to Excel
6. Consider whether or not to modify to allow for 'special'/unusual tuition levels

		Students who have discounts on tuition fees (for any reason)
			> Bursaries
			> 10% discount
			> Special situations with overseas scholarships

		The easiest way to take pt2 into account would be to create new lines in the tuition .csv showing different 'versions' of the same programme (e.g. EE_ConacyctMexico)
		and to rename the column 'Programme_Fee' in that file (so that it can be called when merging files to calculate tuition stuff)

		Then, the only adjust that has to be made is in the attendance sheets/dissertation sheets. Another column would needed to be added 'Programme_Fee' to hold the different verions.

		A student would then have an entry that was either the standard name or the relevant version that applies to them. This 'Programme_Fee' column would need to be referenced whenver
		a list of student info is merged with tuition info (to ensure the correct tuition version is paired with each student). The 'normal' Programme column can be used for all other 
		stuff in the code as it is now.

***Assumptions in the code***
1. We only invoice the university for the administration costs in the year a PT student completes their dissertation
2. A 'straight' 5% of the full tuition fee is calculated for each student taking an SRUC course, regardless of what programme/school they are from
3. A 'straight' 10% of the full tuition fee is calculated in association with supervision for each student, regardless of what programme/school they are from 
4. The fraction of the tuition fee that goes to administration is 40%. Of this, SRUC gets 75% and GeoSciences 15%
5. The only relevant schools are GeoSciences, SPSS, Law, Engineering, and Business
6. Students from any programme within these schools may end up using SRUC resources
7. SRUC education staff involved in supervising dissertations are counted as Crosp & Soils staff in order to distinguish them from LEES staff (as this is the big cost centre split)
 
Notational Requirements within the code:
1. The following abbreviations must be used when referring to individual programmes: EE	EPM	FS	SS	SPH
2. The following abbreviations must be used when referring to individual courses: 
		Foundations in Ecological Economics 	- FEE
		ENvironmental Valuation					- EV
		Applications in Ecological Economics	- AEE
		Participation in Policy and Planning	- PPP
		Environmental Impact Assessment			- EIA
		...
		
***Set-up Requirements***
1. Create a folder where the analysis will be undertaken and call it 'SRUC MOU Calculation 2016' (substituting the year as appropriate)
2. Within this folder, create two folders: one called 'Inputs', one called 'Outputs'
3. Look up the file path that takes you into your 'SRUC MOU Calculation 2016' folder (as you'll need this to set the working directory for R)
4. Ensure that the R package 'xlsx' is installed in your version of R
		
***Inputs Required to Run the Code (each of which must be a .csv file)***
1. A file with the tuition fee data for the all programmes in the relevant schools in the year of interest. 

Total Number of files of this type: 1
	
	> The file name must have this format: Fees_year.csv (e.g. Fees_2016.csv)
	> The file must use the following headers (and no other ones): Programme	School	H	O
		> H stands for 'home fees'
		> O stands for 'overseas fees'

2.  A file for each course that is 'owned' by SRUC showing the attendance list for the year of interest. 

Total Number of files of this type: 12(?)

	> The file name must have this format: CourseAbbreviationyear.csv (e.g. FEE2016.csv)
	> The file must use the following headers (and no other ones): UUN	Surname	Forename	Programme	School	Fee_Status
		> The spellings used within the 'Programme' column must be the same as in the tuition fee file (and all other files using this data)
		> 'Fee_Status' must be shown as either H or O (to match with the tuition fee file)

3. A file for each programme that shows the supervisory arrangements for all students on that programme

Total Number of files of this type: 5

	> The file name must have this format: ProgrammeAbbreviation_Dissertationsyear.csv (e.g. EE_Dissertations2016.csv)
	> The file must use the following headers (and no other ones): UUN	Surname	Forename	Programme	School	Fee_Status	Supervisor	Organisation	Detail
		> The spellings used within the 'Programme' column must be the same as in the tuition fee file (and all other files using this data)
		> 'Fee_Status' must be shown as either 'H' or 'O' (to match with the tuition fee file)
		> 'Organisation' must be shown as either 'SRUC' or 'University'
		> 'Detail' is a column used to show whether a supervisor marked 'SRUC' is actually an SRUC employee or an external
			> Accepable entries are 'SRUC' or 'External'

4. A file showing which SRUC staff are supervising non-SRUC dissertations

Total Number of files of this type: 1

	> The file name must have this format: SRUC_ExternalDissertationsyear.csv (e.g. SRUC_ExternalDissertations2016.csv)
	> The file must use the following headers (and no other ones): UUN	Surname	Forename	Programme	School	Fee_Status	Supervisor	Research_Group
		> The spellings used within the 'Programme' column must be the same as in the tuition fee file (and all other files using this data)
		> 'Fee_Status' must be shown as either 'H' or 'O' (to match with the tuition fee file)
		> 'Research_Group' is used to distinguish between LEES and Crops & Soils (any Education staff supervising are counted as being in Crops & Soils for this script)
			> Acceptable entires are 'LEES' or 'CropsSoils'
			
Total Number of Input Files Needed: 19(?)

***Running the Code / Completing the Analysis ***
The following steps are required in order to run the code and complete the analysis:

...

***Outputs Generated***
The script will generate 6 outputs: One summary file containing everything, and one file for each MSc programme. 
These will be created within the 'Outputs' folder created in the setup step described above
